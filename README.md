## VEHICLE SECURITY SYSTEM USING FACE RECOGNITION
High number of motor vehicle thefts, especially motorcycles, remains unresolved.Intelligent security system using facial recognition to identify vehicle owners.Notification system alerts when a non-owner drives the motorcycle.Increase motorcycle security, minimize theft, and enhance rider safety.Literature review of past research to propose a novel system for early owner detection.


## About
Vehicle theft remains a significant issue, causing financial losses and safety concerns for owners.Traditional security systems like key locks, remote controls, and alarms are vulnerable to modern theft methods (e.g., key duplication, signal interception, and hacking).These systems lack personalized access control, allowing potential misuse or unauthorized access.There is a need for an advanced security mechanism that is robust, reliable, and user-friendly.Face recognition technology offers a non-intrusive, efficient, and accurate solution for personalized vehicle access.Integrating facial recognition into vehicle security can minimize theft risks and improve overall safety by allowing access only to authorized users.
